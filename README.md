# RevolVR - *A VR-focused game engine*
> **_NOTE:_** This repo contains only the headers, src, and third party libraries for building. If you are looking for examples see the [sample project](https://github.com/satchelfrost/revolvr-sample-project.git)

## Primary Goals
* To make a purpose built game for Oculus Quest 1/2
* Enable people in the native Oculus Quest (or native android) development community examples
* Utilize OpenXR and Vulkan to enable the engine to grow as time goes on

## Primary Features
* OpenXR compatibility
* Vulkan compatibility
* An Entity Component System (ECS)
* A scene description file used to build scenes
* Spatial Audio (using OVRAudio)

## Primary platforms
* Android (Oculus Quest 1/2)
> **_IMPORTANT:_** Currently RevolVR only supports, and has been tested on the Oculus Quest 1/2. We hope to expand this in the future.
